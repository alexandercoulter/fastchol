Description: This package provides fast implementations of Cholesky updates, including rank-1 updates (cholup), rank-1 downdates (choldown), dropping a row/column from the parent matrix (choldrop), adding a row/column (choladd), transpose, backsolve/forwardsolve, and the Cholesky decomposition itself. All operations are supported with lower or upper Cholesky factors.
